## Simulation Tools

*[A colleague](https://demoor.org/author/hans-m-demoor/) recommended LTSpice and CircuitLab. We will try both. We are less interested in the circuit-simulation aspect of the tools than we are in having a tool in which we can easily draw circuit diagrams. Hopefully we build sufficient intuition that we can predict our circuits' behvavior ourselves.*
