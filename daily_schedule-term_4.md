### Week 2 &mdash; Power &mdash; Circuit Diagrams &mdash; Kirchhoff's Laws

* Tuesday, Jan. 20
  * Practice: The circuit diagram of [The Simplest Possible Circuit](./circuit-diagrams/TheSimplestPossibleCircuit.jpeg) that you built last time
  * Theory: [Resistance and Power, with Examples](./theory/2026-01-20-ResistanceAndPowerWithExamples.nb.pdf)
  * Practice: Let's build the two second-simplest circuits! You will start reading circuit diagrams!
    * Build the circuit diagrammed in [Two Resistors in Series](./circuit-diagrams/TwoResistorsInSeries.jpeg)
    * Build the circuit diagrammed in [Two Resistors in Parallel](./circuit-diagrams/TwoResistorsInParallel.jpeg)
* Friday, Jan. 23
  * Theory: Come with the 20 problems in the last handout completed! We will go over them at the beginning of class.
  * Practice: A circuit that lights an LED solidly
  * Theory: [Kirchhoff's Laws](./theory/2026-01-23-KirchhoffsLaws.nb.pdf)
  * Practice: Let's build Mims' first circuit on pp. 14-18, a circuit that flashes an LED

### Week 3 &mdash; Resistors in Series and Parallel &mdash; Voltage Dividers &mdash; Switches

* Tuesday, Jan. 27
  * Theory: Resistors in Series and In Parallel Examples from Howard Gerrish, *Electronics*
  	* Threory: How does mileage in mpg add? Example: two vehicles with 15mpg and 30mpg.
  * Practice: Let's build as much as we can on pp. 19-22, first a black box test circuit, and then a series of circuits that illustrate switches
* Friday, Jan. 30
