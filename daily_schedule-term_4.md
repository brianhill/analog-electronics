  * Practice: Load the batteries into the kit and separate out the resistors
  * Theory: [What is Resistance?](./theory/2026-01-16-WhatIsResistance.nb.pdf)
  * Practice: Resistor color coding
  * Practice: Build the circuit diagrammed in [The Simplest Possible Circuit](./circuit-diagrams/TheSimplestPossibleCircuit.jpeg)

### Week 2 &mdash; Power &mdash; Circuit Diagrams

* Tuesday, Jan. 20
  * Practice: The circuit diagram of [The Simplest Possible Circuit](./circuit-diagrams/TheSimplestPossibleCircuit.jpeg) that you built last time
  * Theory: [Resistance and Power, with Examples](./theory/2026-01-20-ResistanceAndPowerWithExamples.nb.pdf)
  * Practice: Let's build the two second-simplest circuits! You will start reading circuit diagrams!
    * Build the circuit diagrammed in [Two Resistors in Series](./circuit-diagrams/TwoResistorsInSeries.jpeg)
    * Build the circuit diagrammed in [Two Resistors in Parallel](./circuit-diagrams/TwoResistorsInParallel.jpeg)
* Friday, Jan. 23
  * Theory: Come with the 20 problems in the last handout completed! We will go over them at the beginning of class. 20 problems is enough for each of you to answer 4 of them.
  * Practice: A circuit that lights an LED
  * Practice: Let's go through Mims' first circuit on pp. 14-18, &ldquo;A Simple LED Flasher&rdquo;
